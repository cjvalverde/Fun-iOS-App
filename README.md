# Fun-iOS-App
First iOS App to test Xcode in a MacOS Virtual machine runing on Windows10 host. Testing full workflow from desing to install in iPhone 6s through Google Drive and AppCake (VM on VirtualBox) and directly installing it on iPhone with XCode (VM on VMWare) App with basic functionality labels and buttons to modify label contents.

App has only be tested on iPhone 6s

Workflow through Apcake does not work anymore, since Apcake has been blocked by iOS

It was not possible to connect iPhone to Virtual Mac with VirtualBox due to USB drivers => changed from VirtualBox to VMWare only to which it was possible to connect iPhone to Virtual Mac. No Appcake needed anymore
